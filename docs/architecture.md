# Identity Forge — architecture & contributor reference

A map of how the pack fits together, the data schemas, and the conventions that keep
changes safe. Aimed at anyone (human or agent) extending the data or the engine.

Pack is **V3 API** (`comfy_api.latest`), category `conditioning/character`, **zero deps**,
fully offline. The engine half of every node is a pure function importable without ComfyUI
(that's how the tests run headless).

## Nodes & data flow

The four preset nodes each emit a grouped-JSON **`character_json`** string and chain through
an optional **`upstream`** input. They wire into IdentityForge's single **`archetype_json`**
socket. On overlap, the node **closest to IdentityForge wins** (downstream wins); a node set to
`None` emits `{}` and passes its upstream through. `merge_preset_documents` (deep-merge, incl.
`_meta`) is the chaining primitive.

```
Archetype ─▶ Cosplayer ─▶ Creature ─▶ Modifier ─▶ IdentityForge ─▶ prompt_text + prompt_json
```

- **IdentityForge** ([nodes/identity_forge.py](../nodes/identity_forge.py)) — the engine. 70+
  lockable dropdowns + control toggles → randomize → constraints → prose + JSON. Entry point
  `generate_character(...)`; widget schema in `define_schema`.
- **Cosplayer** → `build_cosplayer_json`: a character's `costume` becomes the hidden
  `outfit_description` lock; `signature` (hair/eyes) always applied; `physique` only in *Full
  character* mode; `covers_face`/`mask`/`prop` handled here.
- **Creature** → `build_creature_json`: emits a `Species & Anatomy` group + `_meta`
  (`form`, `suppress_groups`, `suppress_fields`).
- **Modifier** → prepends a descriptor to one field or a whole group.
- **Vault Save/Load** → persist a generated `prompt_json` under `ComfyUI/user/identity_forge/`.

## fields.py — the field engine

`FIELD_DEFINITIONS` is an `OrderedDict[name -> {group, female_options, male_options, optional,
…}]`. Notes:

- **Control fields** carry `"control": True` (`gender`, `hair_color_scope`, `location_setting`):
  read from their toggle, never randomized, never described. `_CONTROL_FIELDS` collects them.
- **Hidden fields** (`outfit_description`, `held_item`): free-form prose locks, no widget;
  `_HIDDEN_FIELDS` / `_PRESET_HIDDEN_FIELDS`.
- **Gender-divergent fields** are the only ones whose female/male pools differ: **`bust`,
  `facial_hair`, `makeup_style`, `hair_accessory`** (`hair_accessory` gives random women the
  full feminine range but random men only a small unisex set, so a bow never lands on a random
  male). These (and only these) are mirrored in the JS `GENDER_POOLS` for live gender-swap —
  **edit both Python and JS when you touch them**.
- **Absence model (important).** `_is_absent(v)` treats `""`, `"None"`, `"Random"`, `"none"`,
  any `"no …"`, and `_ABSENCE_EXACT` (`bare nails`, `clean shaven`, `natural bare`,
  `bare natural lips`) as "omit from prose". `_EXTRA_ABSENCE` maps accessory fields to their
  canonical absent token + a base probability — the `accessory_density` control injects it so
  portraits aren't over-accessorised. **Those absent tokens must stay in the pools** (the
  density logic needs them); they are merely *hidden from the widget*.
- **Widget building** (`define_schema`): each field combo = `["Random"] + <real options, with
  `_is_absent` values filtered out> + ["None"]`. Result: exactly one "omit" affordance
  (`None`). Picking `None` == any in-pool absent value == omit.
- **Weighted hair-style pick.** `hair_style` is the one field that does **not** use a flat
  `rng.choice`: `_pick_hair_style` first draws a family from `HAIR_STYLE_FAMILIES` (weighted by
  `weight`, frozen to each family's original variant count, sum = 30), then a variant uniformly
  within it. So adding a variant subdivides its family's share instead of inflating it (3
  ponytails still total the same ~6.7% the 2 originals did). The flat option list still drives
  the widget (every variant lockable); `validate_data` checks the families partition it exactly.
  New variants must also be slotted into the relevant `data/constraints.py` length lists
  (`_LONG_HAIR_STYLES`, the pixie exclusion) so they're culled on short hair like their siblings.

## cosplayers.py — characters as a worn look

`COSPLAYERS: dict[name -> entry]`. Required: `franchise`, `gender` (`Female`/`Male` — SOURCE
gender, used only to scope the `Random — female/male` picks; the *person's* gender is the
IdentityForge widget, so crossplay works), `costume`. Optional: `signature` / `physique`
`{field: value}` maps (values **must** be valid `FIELD_DEFINITIONS` options — `validate_data`
enforces), `covers_face` + `mask`, `prop`, and `eyes` (free-text eye-colour override).

Conventions (keep the data coherent):

- **Worn, not held.** `costume` lists only worn items and reads after "She/He wears …"
  (lowercase, leading article). Held/wielded props go in the optional `prop` (emitted only when
  the node's prop toggle is on, voiced "holding …").
- **Full masks/helmets:** `covers_face: True` **and** the head covering in a separate `mask`
  string (kept out of `costume`) so the *Unmask* toggle can drop it. IdentityForge then
  suppresses Face/Hair/Makeup (+ earrings/piercings). Omit both when the face shows.
- **Bald / shaven-headed:** state it in `costume` (e.g. "…, and a clean-shaven bald head"); do
  **not** lock a `hair_length`/`hair_style` (locking `buzzed very short` renders a buzz cut —
  the Mace Windu bug). A `facial_hair: "clean shaven"` lock is fine.
- **Non-human skin / body paint:** word as `"an even, smooth coat of <colour> body paint"`
  (textured: `"an even, all-over coat of …"` + keep the texture word); leave `skin_tone` out so
  the person underneath randomizes. The builder **auto-detects this `an even … coat of …` marker**
  (face-visible entries only) and force-locks `skin_tone`, `complexion`, `skin_details`,
  `freckles_density`, `makeup_style` (→ `no makeup`, which cascades every cosmetic sub-field
  absent), and the skin-toned makeup (`blush`, `skin_finish`, `contour`, `highlight`)
  absent — otherwise a random human skin tone/complexion *or* a randomized `makeup_style`
  ("soft glam" with no foundation colour) renders the *face* pale under the paint (the
  She-Hulk green-body/pale-face bug). An explicit `body_paint: True/False` entry key
  overrides the auto-detection. See `_BODY_PAINT_RE` / `_BODY_PAINT_SUPPRESS` in
  `nodes/identity_forge_cosplayer.py`.
- **Elemental / energy beings whose head is also covered** (Human Torch flame, Ghost Rider
  skull): prefer the `covers_face` + `mask` mechanism (head described in `mask`) over a plain
  body-paint coat. `covers_face` drops the Face/Hair/Makeup groups, so no random hair/face
  contradicts the effect (a plain body-paint coat suppresses skin but **not** hair, leaving a
  "bald head in costume + random hair in prose" mismatch — see Doctor Manhattan / Voldemort).
  Trade-off: `covers_face` does not suppress the Body-group `skin_tone`, so a faint "X skin"
  can still appear in Costume-only mode; the dominant effect prose overrides it in practice.
- **Extreme-size characters** (Giganta, Titania, Giant-Man): put the scale in `costume` prose
  ("towering 50-foot stature, …") — there is no size field for humans.
- **Plain ASCII only** in names and text (no em/en dashes, smart quotes, accents — e.g. use
  `Padme`, `Eowyn`). Tokenizers mangle the rest. Names are dict keys: a duplicate **silently
  overrides** — grep before adding.
- **Iconic non-standard eyes** (red/violet/gold cat-slit) use the free-text `eyes` override
  (a top-level entry key, not the signature) — it replaces `eye_color` and is voiced verbatim,
  passing the gender gate because `eye_color`'s pools are identical. The main node's dropdown
  stays believable (no fantasy colours added there). The cosplayer also locks `eye_shape` **and
  `eye_size`** to `None` (injected after `group_fields`, which strips them on the build side) so
  no random shape/size word contradicts the free-text description — the engine keeps the locked
  `None` as absent and drops it from prose/JSON.
- **Random scope.** `_FRANCHISE_CATEGORY` maps every franchise to one of nine broad categories
  (Anime & Manga, Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Disney, Video Games, Fantasy & Literature, Movies & TV,
  Comics & Cartoons). The Cosplayer node's `random_scope` control narrows the `Random — …` picks
  by category (combines with the gender scope); `get_cosplayer_names(gender, category)` does the
  filtering. Unmapped franchises fall back to a default.

## creatures.py — non-human form layer

`CREATURES: dict[name -> {class, palette, <slots>}]`. Slots: `head`, `eyes`, `integument`
(required) + optional `arms`, `hands`, `legs_feet`, `wings`, `tail`, `extras`. Slot text is
free-form prose (own render path — not validated against human fields). Rules:

- **Integument is colour-free**; the hue lives in `palette` and is prepended at render
  (`_prepend_descriptor` fixes a/an). Texture words stay in `integument`.
- **`palette_pool`** (optional list): for amorphous/colour-variable creatures (blob, slime,
  energy being, jellyfish, crystalline alien). When the node palette is `Auto` it draws a
  seed-varied hue from the pool instead of the single `palette` (so they aren't one fixed
  colour). The palette combo also offers `Random` (rolls `_PALETTES` for any creature). The
  palette RNG draw happens **last** in `build_creature_json`, after creature/slot/form picks,
  so existing seeds keep their creature and only colour shifts; the `Auto`+no-pool path draws no
  RNG and is byte-identical to before.
- **Suppression:** a creature `head` hides human Face/Hair/Makeup; `integument` hides skin
  fields; `form` (Anthropomorphic/Feral/Subtle) sets group-level suppression. Generalizes the
  cosplayer `covers_face` mechanism via `_meta.suppress_groups` / `suppress_fields`.

## Extending at runtime — user_options.json

`data/user_options.py` merges an optional pack-root `user_options.json` at import (sections:
`fields`, `outfits`, `archetypes`, `cosplayers`, `creatures`). Fails closed on a bad file. User
entries override built-ins of the same name. `palette_pool` is a built-in-only key (the user
creature loader copies only the standard slots).

## Validation, tests, versioning

- `python tests/validate_data.py` — value integrity: every signature/physique/constraint/
  archetype value must be a real field option; mask rules; creature structure (allowed keys:
  `class`, `palette`, `palette_pool`, slots; non-empty strings, `palette_pool` a non-empty list
  of strings); studio-backdrop/skin-tone/ethnicity affinity maps.
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — engine + creature + vault (headless).
- **Version:** bump `pyproject.toml` on every functional commit — **minor** for feature/content,
  **patch** for fixes (standing order).
- **JS regen:** `js/identity_forge.js` embeds `GROUP_ORDER` / `FIELD_TO_GROUP` / `GENDER_POOLS`
  from `data/fields.py`; update it when the field set or the gender-divergent pools change.

## Gotchas cheat-sheet

- Duplicate `COSPLAYERS` / `CREATURES` keys silently override — the last wins.
- `signature`/`physique` values are gender-gated downstream; prefer unisex fields for crossplay.
- A locked physique doesn't constrain `fitness`/`muscle` (known loose coherence).
- Adding RNG draws in the creature node mid-sequence shifts seed→creature mapping — append draws
  at the end.
- The roster is large (~840 cosplayers, ~130 creatures): always grep the current keys before
  adding to avoid silent overrides.
