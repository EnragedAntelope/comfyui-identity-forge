# Identity Forge — architecture & contributor reference

A map of how the pack fits together, the data schemas, and the conventions that keep
changes safe. Aimed at anyone (human or agent) extending the data or the engine.

Pack is **V3 API** (`comfy_api.latest`), category `conditioning/character`, **zero deps**,
fully offline. The engine half of every node is a pure function importable without ComfyUI
(that's how the tests run headless).

## Nodes & data flow

The four preset nodes each emit a grouped-JSON **`character_json`** string and chain through
an optional **`upstream`** input. They wire into IdentityForge's single **`archetype_json`**
socket. On overlap, the node **closest to IdentityForge wins** (downstream wins); a node set to
`None` emits `{}` and passes its upstream through. `merge_preset_documents` (deep-merge, incl.
`_meta`) is the chaining primitive.

```
Archetype ─▶ Cosplayer ─▶ Creature ─▶ Modifier ─▶ IdentityForge ─▶ prompt_text + prompt_json
```

- **IdentityForge** ([nodes/identity_forge.py](../nodes/identity_forge.py)) — the engine. 70+
  lockable dropdowns + control toggles → randomize → constraints → prose + JSON. Entry point
  `generate_character(...)`; widget schema in `define_schema`.
- **Cosplayer** → `build_cosplayer_json`: a character's `costume` becomes the hidden
  `outfit_description` lock; `signature` (hair/eyes) always applied; `physique` only in *Full
  character* mode; `covers_face`/`mask`/`prop` handled here.
- **Creature** → `build_creature_json`: emits a `Species & Anatomy` group + `_meta`
  (`form`, `suppress_groups`, `suppress_fields`).
- **Modifier** → prepends a descriptor to one field or a whole group.
- **Vault Save/Load** → persist a generated `prompt_json` under `ComfyUI/user/identity_forge/`.

## fields.py — the field engine

`FIELD_DEFINITIONS` is an `OrderedDict[name -> {group, female_options, male_options, optional,
…}]`. Notes:

- **Control fields** carry `"control": True` (`gender`, `hair_color_scope`, `location_setting`):
  read from their toggle, never randomized, never described. `_CONTROL_FIELDS` collects them.
- **Hidden fields** (`outfit_description`, `held_item`): free-form prose locks, no widget;
  `_HIDDEN_FIELDS` / `_PRESET_HIDDEN_FIELDS`.
- **Gender-divergent fields** are the only ones whose female/male pools differ: **`bust`,
  `facial_hair`, `makeup_style`, `hair_accessory`** (`hair_accessory` gives random women the
  full feminine range but random men only a small unisex set, so a bow never lands on a random
  male). These (and only these) are mirrored in the JS `GENDER_POOLS` for live gender-swap —
  **edit both Python and JS when you touch them**.
- **Absence model (important).** `_is_absent(v)` treats `""`, `"None"`, `"Random"`, `"none"`,
  any `"no …"`, and `_ABSENCE_EXACT` (`bare nails`, `clean shaven`, `natural bare`,
  `bare natural lips`) as "omit from prose". `_EXTRA_ABSENCE` maps accessory fields to their
  canonical absent token + a base probability — the `accessory_density` control injects it so
  portraits aren't over-accessorised. **Those absent tokens must stay in the pools** (the
  density logic needs them); they are merely *hidden from the widget*.
- **Widget building** (`define_schema`): each field combo = `["Random"] + <real options, with
  `_is_absent` values filtered out> + ["None"]`. Result: exactly one "omit" affordance
  (`None`). Picking `None` == any in-pool absent value == omit.
- **Weighted family pick (the bias-safe growth channel).** Fields registered in `FIELD_FAMILIES`
  do **not** use a flat `rng.choice`: `_pick_family_weighted(field, pool, rng)` first draws a family
  (weighted by `weight`, frozen to each family's *original* variant count), then a variant uniformly
  within it. So adding a variant subdivides its family's share instead of inflating it, and the
  field's top-level distribution never shifts — the safe way to enlarge a flat field without biasing
  randomization. Because each weight equals the family's original size, the pick reproduces a flat
  uniform draw until new variants are added. Registered fields: `hair_style` (`HAIR_STYLE_FAMILIES`),
  `expression`, `mood`, `pose`, `lighting`, `location` (each `<FIELD>_FAMILIES` in `data/fields.py`).
  The picker intersects each family's variants with `pool` and drops empty families, so upstream
  filtering still composes — e.g. the `location_setting` Indoor/Outdoor/Studio scope, or a hair-length
  constraint. The flat option list still drives the widget (every variant lockable); `validate_data`
  checks **every** `FIELD_FAMILIES` entry partitions its field's options exactly. New `hair_style`
  variants must also be slotted into the relevant `data/constraints.py` length lists
  (`_LONG_HAIR_STYLES`, the pixie exclusion) so they're culled on short hair like their siblings.

## cosplayers.py — characters as a worn look

`COSPLAYERS: dict[name -> entry]`. Required: `franchise`, `gender` (`Female`/`Male` — SOURCE
gender, used only to scope the `Random — female/male` picks; the *person's* gender is the
IdentityForge widget, so crossplay works), `costume`. Optional: `signature` / `physique`
`{field: value}` maps (values **must** be valid `FIELD_DEFINITIONS` options — `validate_data`
enforces), `covers_face` + `mask`, `covers_hair`, `body_paint`, `prop`, `eyes` (free-text
eye-colour override), and `skin` (free-text body-paint skin-colour anchor).

Conventions (keep the data coherent):

- **Worn, not held.** `costume` lists only worn items and reads after "She/He wears …"
  (lowercase, leading article). Held/wielded props go in the optional `prop` (emitted only when
  the node's prop toggle is on, voiced "holding …").
- **Full masks/helmets:** `covers_face: True` **and** the head covering in a separate `mask`
  string (kept out of `costume`) so the *Unmask* toggle can drop it. IdentityForge then
  suppresses Face/Hair/Makeup (+ earrings/piercings). Omit both when the face shows.
- **Bald / shaven-headed:** state it in `costume` (e.g. "…, and a clean-shaven bald head") — the
  builder auto-detects it and locks the scalp-hair (and, for "clean-shaven", facial-hair) fields
  absent (see the Bald / Clean-shaven notes below). Do **not** lock a `hair_length`/`hair_style`
  (locking `buzzed very short` renders a buzz cut — the Mace Windu bug).
- **Non-human skin / body paint:** word as `"an even, smooth coat of <colour> body paint"`
  (textured: `"an even, all-over coat of …"` + keep the texture word); leave `skin_tone` out so
  the person underneath randomizes. The builder **auto-detects this `an even … coat of …` marker**
  (face-visible entries only) and force-locks `skin_tone`, `complexion`, `skin_details`,
  `freckles_density`, `makeup_style` (→ `no makeup`, which cascades every cosmetic sub-field
  absent), and the skin-toned makeup (`blush`, `skin_finish`, `contour`, `highlight`)
  absent — otherwise a random human skin tone/complexion *or* a randomized `makeup_style`
  ("soft glam" with no foundation colour) renders the *face* pale under the paint (the
  She-Hulk green-body/pale-face bug). An explicit `body_paint: True/False` entry key
  overrides the auto-detection. This suppression **also runs when the face is masked**
  (`covers_face`): `covers_face` hides the Face/Hair/Makeup groups but **not** the Body-group
  `skin_tone`, so an all-over coat (Human Torch flame) would otherwise still report a stray
  skin tone under it. See `_BODY_PAINT_RE` / `_BODY_PAINT_SUPPRESS` in
  `nodes/identity_forge_cosplayer.py`.
- **Skin-colour anchor (re-plant the colour).** Suppressing `skin_tone` leaves the *opening*
  prose with no skin colour ("…with a slim build and tall."), so t2i routinely defaults the
  high-attention **face** to a human tone (the Poison Ivy white-face / TMNT pale-face bug). After
  suppression the builder **re-injects the paint colour into `skin_tone`** so the lead sentence
  anchors it ("…tall, **and vivid green skin**"). The colour is auto-derived from the
  `"coat of <colour> <material>"` clause (`_BODY_PAINT_COLOR_RE` → `_body_paint_skin_color`); an
  explicit free-text **`skin` entry key** wins for phrasings the regex misses (`ice`, `chitin`,
  `tattoos`, no-"coat of" prose) or where a cleaner word reads better — it mirrors the `eyes`
  override and is voiced verbatim. The anchor is a *wired value*, so it survives both look-levels
  and "set all to none". The demographics formatter (`_format_…`) guards the trailing `" skin"`
  when the value already ends in a skin/fur/scale/hide word ("dark blue scaled-skin"). For a
  genuinely non-human **face** prefer Pattern A (`covers_face` + `mask`) over relying on the anchor
  alone (TMNT turtles, King Shark, Abe Sapien, Jar Jar Binks, Despero); humanoid coloured
  characters (She-Hulk, Mystique, Gamora) stay face-visible and lean on the anchor.
- **Bald characters:** state it in `costume` ("a bald head", "a clean-shaven bald scalp"). The
  builder **auto-detects `\bbald\b`** (won't catch "baldric") and locks the scalp-hair fields
  (`hair_color/length/texture/style/part/volume/highlights/accessory`) absent, so a random
  "His hair is …" line can't contradict the bald head (the Doctor Manhattan / Voldemort bug).
  Auto-detected bald is **scalp-only** (a bald man may keep a beard). For a *fully* hairless
  head (creatures/aliens — Kilowog, King Shark, Despero) set the explicit `bald: True` key,
  which also clears `facial_hair`. `setdefault` semantics: a deliberate signature lock (topknot,
  stray hairs, a beard) still wins. See `_BALD_RE` / `_BALD_SUPPRESS`.
- **Clean-shaven faces:** `"clean-shaven"`/`"clean shaven"` in `costume` **auto-locks**
  `facial_hair` absent so a random beard can't sprout on a bare face. See `_CLEAN_SHAVEN_RE`.
- **Gloved hands:** a costume that covers the hands (`glove`/`gauntlet`/`mitten`) makes the
  engine force the finger fields (`nails`, `rings`, and ring-typed `other_jewelry`) absent —
  otherwise a randomized polish/ring renders *on top of* the glove. This lives in the **engine**
  (`generate_character`, `_GLOVE_RE`), not the cosplayer builder, so it also covers archetype
  costumes and random outfits. `"fingerless"` anywhere in the text opts out (fingers exposed →
  nails/rings stay). A user-locked `nails`/`rings` is respected. **Power rings worn over the
  glove** (Green Lantern, Sinestro) belong in the `costume` prose ("a glowing green power ring
  worn on the finger"), not the `rings` field, so they survive the suppression — keep writing
  them that way. (For an all-metal robot like the Cylon Centurion, give it `gauntlets` so the
  finger details drop.)
- **Full hard shell (`covers_body`):** a robot / droid / powered-armour / full-plate /
  exoskeleton body has no bare skin for worn jewellery, so the engine drops the whole
  **Jewelry & Nails** group. It auto-detects from the costume prose (`_FULL_COVER_RE` —
  `robot`, `droid`, `exoskeleton`, `plate armor`, `armored bodysuit`, …) and also honours an
  explicit `covers_body: True` entry key for cases the prose doesn't spell out (Nebula,
  Man-At-Arms). Independent of `covers_face` (a face mask doesn't imply a covered body, and a
  covered body may still show the face). Body/demographics stay (the silhouette has a build).
  **Fully encased** (`covers_face` **and** a full shell): the body's `skin_tone` is dropped too —
  the only Body-group skin field `covers_face` doesn't already hide — so a masked droid/armour
  (Iron Man, 2-1B) reports no stray human skin tone under the plating.
- **Hood / cowl / lekku (`covers_hair`):** a head covering that fully encloses the scalp while the
  **face still shows** (a snug cowl, a jester hood, a Twi'lek's lekku) has no visible hair, so a
  randomized "Her hair is …" line only fights the look. The `covers_hair: True` entry key drops the
  whole **Hair** group (engine `_CONCEALED_HAIR_GROUPS`) but keeps Face + Makeup — narrower than
  `covers_face`. Apply it only when the covering truly encloses the scalp and **no signature hair
  is locked** (an iconic fringe under the hood = leave it off): Harley (Classic Jester), Blue Beetle
  (Ted Kord), Bib Fortuna. Independent of `covers_face` (which already drops Hair on its own).
- **Elemental / energy beings whose head is also covered** (Human Torch flame, Ghost Rider
  skull): use the `covers_face` + `mask` mechanism (head described in `mask`) so no random
  hair/face contradicts the effect, and keep the `an even … coat of …` body-paint phrasing in
  `costume` so the Body-group `skin_tone` is suppressed too (see body-paint note above).
- **Extreme-size characters** (Giganta, Titania, Giant-Man): put the scale in `costume` prose
  ("towering 50-foot stature, …") — there is no size field for humans.
- **Plain ASCII only** in names and text (no em/en dashes, smart quotes, accents — e.g. use
  `Padme`, `Eowyn`). Tokenizers mangle the rest. Names are dict keys: a duplicate **silently
  overrides** — grep before adding.
- **Iconic non-standard eyes** (red/violet/gold cat-slit) use the free-text `eyes` override
  (a top-level entry key, not the signature) — it replaces `eye_color` and is voiced verbatim,
  passing the gender gate because `eye_color`'s pools are identical. The main node's dropdown
  stays believable (no fantasy colours added there). The cosplayer also locks `eye_shape` **and
  `eye_size`** to `None` (injected after `group_fields`, which strips them on the build side) so
  no random shape/size word contradicts the free-text description — the engine keeps the locked
  `None` as absent and drops it from prose/JSON.
- **Random scope.** `_FRANCHISE_CATEGORY` maps every franchise to one of nine broad categories
  (Anime & Manga, Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Disney, Video Games, Fantasy & Literature, Movies & TV,
  Comics & Cartoons). The Cosplayer node's `random_scope` control narrows the `Random — …` picks
  by category (combines with the gender scope); `get_cosplayer_names(gender, category)` does the
  filtering. Unmapped franchises fall back to a default.

## creatures.py — non-human form layer

`CREATURES: dict[name -> {class, palette, <slots>}]`. Slots: `head`, `eyes`, `integument`
(required) + optional `arms`, `hands`, `legs_feet`, `wings`, `tail`, `extras`. Slot text is
free-form prose (own render path — not validated against human fields). Rules:

- **Integument is colour-free**; the hue lives in `palette` and is prepended at render
  (`_prepend_descriptor` fixes a/an). Texture words stay in `integument`.
- **`palette_pool`** (optional list): for amorphous/colour-variable creatures (blob, slime,
  energy being, jellyfish, crystalline alien). When the node palette is `Auto` it draws a
  seed-varied hue from the pool instead of the single `palette` (so they aren't one fixed
  colour). The palette combo also offers `Random` (rolls `_PALETTES` for any creature). The
  palette RNG draw happens **last** in `build_creature_json`, after creature/slot/form picks,
  so existing seeds keep their creature and only colour shifts; the `Auto`+no-pool path draws no
  RNG and is byte-identical to before.
- **Suppression:** a creature `head` hides human Face/Hair/Makeup; `integument` hides skin
  fields; `form` (Anthropomorphic/Feral/Subtle) sets group-level suppression. Generalizes the
  cosplayer `covers_face` mechanism via `_meta.suppress_groups` / `suppress_fields`.

## Extending at runtime — user_options.json

`data/user_options.py` merges an optional pack-root `user_options.json` at import (sections:
`fields`, `outfits`, `archetypes`, `cosplayers`, `creatures`). Fails closed on a bad file. User
entries override built-ins of the same name. `palette_pool` is a built-in-only key (the user
creature loader copies only the standard slots).

## Validation, tests, versioning

- `python tests/validate_data.py` — value integrity: every signature/physique/constraint/
  archetype value must be a real field option; mask rules; creature structure (allowed keys:
  `class`, `palette`, `palette_pool`, slots; non-empty strings, `palette_pool` a non-empty list
  of strings); studio-backdrop/skin-tone/ethnicity affinity maps.
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` — engine + creature + vault (headless).
- **Version:** bump `pyproject.toml` on every functional commit — **minor** for feature/content,
  **patch** for fixes (standing order).
- **JS regen:** `js/identity_forge.js` embeds `GROUP_ORDER` / `FIELD_TO_GROUP` / `GENDER_POOLS`
  from `data/fields.py`; update it when the field set or the gender-divergent pools change.

## Gotchas cheat-sheet

- Duplicate `COSPLAYERS` / `CREATURES` keys silently override — the last wins.
- `signature`/`physique` values are gender-gated downstream; prefer unisex fields for crossplay.
- A locked physique doesn't constrain `fitness`/`muscle` (known loose coherence).
- Adding RNG draws in the creature node mid-sequence shifts seed→creature mapping — append draws
  at the end.
- The roster is large (~840 cosplayers, ~130 creatures): always grep the current keys before
  adding to avoid silent overrides.
- Gloved/gauntleted costumes suppress randomized `nails`/`rings` in the engine (`_GLOVE_RE`);
  a **full hard shell** (robot/droid/powered-armour/full-plate/exoskeleton, detected by
  `_FULL_COVER_RE` or the cosplayer `covers_body` flag) drops the whole **Jewelry & Nails**
  group so an all-armour cosplayer (RoboCop, Iron Man, Cylon) reports no stray necklace. Both
  respect explicit user locks. The shell rule also fires on full-plate **archetypes** (Human
  Knight, Holy Paladin).
- Adding options to a **flat** field shifts its distribution; prefer the density-gated
  `_EXTRA_ABSENCE` fields (variety changes, frequency doesn't). New feminine-coded values on a
  shared-pool field must also be added to `_MALE_EXCLUDED_VALUES` so a random Male skips them.
- **Wired `"None"` is an explicit omit and survives to the engine.** `IdentityForge.execute`
  builds `archetype_locked` from every wired value *except* `"Random"` — so a cosplayer/archetype
  field set to `"None"` (the builder's body-paint, bald, and free-text-eye suppressions) reaches
  the engine as an omit instead of being silently re-randomized by the default `"Random"` widget.
  A deliberate concrete widget choice still overrides it. (Pre-0.27.0 the `"None"` was dropped, so
  She-Hulk rendered a human skin tone under her green and bald characters grew hair — the
  documented suppressions only worked when calling `generate_character` directly, not through the
  node.) Tests that exercise suppression must route through `resolve_locked_fields`, not pass the
  flat preset dict straight in (see `SuppressionLockSurvivalTests`).
